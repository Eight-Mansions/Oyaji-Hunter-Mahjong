Oyaji Hunter Mahjong (April 2023)
####################################

## Intro ##
"Help me, Oyaji Hunter!"

Play the role of Hunter, a vigilante hero who saves women from the clutches
of perverts by beating them at riichi mahjong! Enjoy vibrant anime cutscences
created by legendary animator Ichiro Itano of Macross fame.

“I remember thinking ‘Man, I’m really tired of games where you play mahjong to
strip girls, I want to make one where you save them!’ and that’s how we somehow
got to whatever this is. At first, we didn’t plan on having anime cutscenes
or a theme song, but somehow it just all became a bigger project than
anticipated. I hope everyone’s satisfied with it!” 
– Kenji Eno, Producer

## COMPATIBILITY ISSUE ##
*************************
*!* The game has a random crash issue on ODE devices as of this writing! *!*

A CD-R will run just fine on console and this bug is present on the retail
copy of the game. We've let both Mnemo and Fixel know of the issue, so we'll
update this README if a solution is found. In the meantime, either an emulator
or a blank CD will work just fine.

## Patch Instructions ##
* The patcher expects the ISO version of the game.

### Windows ###
1. Drag and drop your original Japanese ISO image onto the file called
   "Drag and drop ISO on me.bat"
2. If a valid disc image is found, the patched ISO will be created in this folder.

### Other OS ###
This release uses a basic .xdelta patch, so any web-based patching tool or
OS-specific .xdelta patcher should work okay. We've switched from xdelta3
to xdelta to help with compatibility. The .xdelta file is located in the
"patch_data" folder. Apply the patch to your disc.

## Tips ##
- Included in this release is a PDF version of the ultra secret Staff Room!
  We have no idea how to actually get there, however. If you managed to get past
  the basement in the BONUS section, let us know immediately!!! We only know what's
  inside based off files extracted, but would love to see it in real time!

- If you do not know how to play riichi mahjong, we recommend opening the free
  mahjong client Mahjong Soul (assuming they're still alive when you're reading this
  in the year 2031) and playing their tutorial - https://mahjongsoul.yo-star.com/
  Otherwise, the tutorial section in the game has some basic information.

- There is no saving in the game, but a level select code exists if you want
  to start where you left off. On the title screen, press
  "Up, Right, Down, Left, Up, Down, Left, Right, L, R, B, C, B" to open the
  menu.
  HOWEVER! A true Hunter completes the game from start to finish!
  # WARNING # You can't see the end credits if you use the level select code!
